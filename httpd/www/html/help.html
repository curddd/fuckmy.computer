<h1>How to use this site<h1>
<pre>
When you enter a username that is not taken, a new user is created on this machine, with the default password "secure".
You can now ssh into this machine with those credentials.

After loggigng in the first step should be to change your password with the command "passwd" and set a new password.


With Linux you can just type "ssh user@host"
Windows has a program called Putty
There are various SSH clients for mobile phones, JuiceSSH or WebSSH are okay.
</pre>

<h2>What can I do with this login?</h2>
You can use all the programs you are allowed to, for example "mail" or "irssi".

I recommend using "tmux", it enables you to keep a session online even after the connection closes.
To start a tmux session just type "tmux".
New windows can be created with CTRL+B and then C
CTRL+B in tmux enables commands, like switching windows, for example CTRL+B and then W lets you select different windows.

One example use would be to keep your irc client (like irssi) open in tmux and stay always online in irc channels.

To detatch from an active tmux session use CTRL+B, D

To go back into your tmux session type "tmux a" into the console.
